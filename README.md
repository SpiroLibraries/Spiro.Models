Spiro.Models
============

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/i602kbacm8be291u)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/scascarini/spiro-models)

Spiro.Models provides a set of JavaScript classes that correspond to the representations defined in the Restful Objects specification.  These classes provide type-safe navigation of the representations, and helper-methods for accessing their contents. 

Spiro.Models is agnostic in regard to JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, Backbone, Knockout  -  it depends only on the Underscore library.

##### Language
Spiro.Angular is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and compiled to JavaScript.
