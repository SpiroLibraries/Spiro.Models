Spiro.Models
============

Spiro.Models provides a set of JavaScript classes that correspond to the representations defined in the Restful Objects specification.  These classes provide type-safe navigation of the representations, and helper-methods for accessing their contents. 

Spiro.Models is written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript.  

Spiro.Models is agnostic in regard to JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, Backbone, Knockout  -  it depends only on the Underscore library.
